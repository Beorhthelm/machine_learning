# Machine Learning

This repository contains small projects that utilize techniques and algorithms of classic ML.

* In `scikit-learn_intro` I use scikit-learn to perform exploratory data analysis and work with text data.

* In `linear_regression` I implement gradient descent and weighted linear regression from scratch. 

* In `cross-validation_and_regularization` I perform feature selection and hyperparameters tuning.

* In `categorical_data` I work with categorical features using various techniques.

* In `ensembling` I construct several machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and Lasso) and blend them into the final ensemble.

More projects will be added over time.
