# Machine Learning

This repository contains small projects that utilize techniques and algorithms of classic ML.

* In `scikit-learn_intro` I use scikit-learn to perform exploratory data analysis and work with text data.

* In `linear_regression` I implement gradient descent and weighted linear regression from scratch. 

* In `cross-validation_and_regularization` I perform feature selection and hyperparameters tuning.

More projects will be added over time.
